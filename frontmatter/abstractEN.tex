A proper understanding of the impact of highway investment is extremely important in determining the need for such investment. The purpose of this study is to clarify the characteristics of radial and ring road network development impact. We define the number of radial road connections and market access as accessibility indicators that take account of the network. We estimate the impact of the accessibility indicators on land value by Two-Way Fixed Effects Model, using land price panel data for the period  2001-2023 within 10km of the Ken-O Expressway in the suburbs of TMA. The results show that the land values are affected by the number of radial road connctions and market access. We also conducted interactions analysis by regional characteristics. As a result, characteristics related to station and land value of reference point (2001) have interactions for the impact of the accessibility indicators on land value.
